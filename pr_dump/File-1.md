## Pending Pull Requests for Virtuo Learn Project

Unfortunately, two of my pull requests for the Virtuo Learn project haven't been merged yet:

1. **[PR #1: Price Cards Fixing](https://github.com/JAYESHBATRA/Virtuo-Learn/pull/433)**
2. **[PR #2: Navbar in "Quizzes" Section fixing](https://github.com/JAYESHBATRA/Virtuo-Learn/pull/431)**
